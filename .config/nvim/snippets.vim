iabbrev !badanswer! Welcome to Stack Overflow. Please read the help pages, take the [SO tour](https://stackoverflow.com/tour), read about [how to ask good questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), as well as [how to answer them](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer). Also, IMO a good answer tends not to include shameless plugs if it can or it at least provides good reasons as to why one might want to use a library / app to solve their problem *instead* of solving it in a native way.
